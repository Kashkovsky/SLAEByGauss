# SLAE Calc Csharp (Win Forms)
Task solution for Kottans

Solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination (also known as row reduction) with the general element in rows.
Calculate the X vector and vector of errors (E = B-A*X):

-3*x1 + 4*x2 + x3 + 4*x4 = -1;

1*x2 + 3*x3 + 2*x4 = -1;

4*x1 - 2*x3 - 3*x4 = 4;

1000*x1 + 3*x2 + x3 - 5*x4 = -2.

The program should contain:
1. Displaying the input data (via tables);
2. Displaying the intermediate solutions;
3. Displaying the X and E vectors;
3. Unit tests for happy and unhappy paths.
